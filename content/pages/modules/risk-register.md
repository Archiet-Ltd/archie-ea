# Risk Register

*Every recorded risk, traced over derived connections to show its real blast radius — not just the
one component it was logged against.*

## What this module does

Ask which risks matter, and the answer doesn't stop at the element a risk was originally logged
against — it follows the same connection chain that answers what breaks, so a risk shows up
everywhere its impact would actually reach.

## Where you'll meet it
