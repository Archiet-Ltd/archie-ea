# Compliance Frameworks

*The filter that turns the Risk Register into a control-gap view — which framework requirements
your model's risks actually touch.*

## What this module does

This module maps the applications in your model against each framework's controls, tracking
implementation status per control. It shows what your own model's data says against a framework's
requirements — never a certification or a guarantee that you pass an audit.
