"""One canonical record of "what roles the product assigns" and "what it
means for a user to have finished onboarding".

Before this module existed, the enterprise-role write and the
onboarding_completed_at write were each copied inline into three call sites
(the retired first-login modal's endpoint -- dashboard.api_onboarding_complete
-- and the five-screen flow's own onboarding.finish route), and the copies had
already drifted: dashboard.api_onboarding_complete's valid-role set was
missing business_architect, so a business architect submitting the old modal
silently had their role write dropped (harmless only because the modal
preselects the user's current role, so the resubmitted value matched what was
already there). One set, one write, three callers.
